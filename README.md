# Project 4 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets using the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [X] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Change button and text color once a tweet is successfully favorited or retweeted.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Is it necessary to sync data (counts) right after favoriting or retweeting?
2. How to recognize URLs in tweet content and convert them into links?
